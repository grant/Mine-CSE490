Project Name: AQT Web Application Demo
Completion Date: November 29th, 2013.
Project Owners: Grant Timmerman

Requirements:

A main page for the web application that serves as the launcher screen for the application.  This page will be the first point of contact or the user, and should contain, at a minimum, the following:
Our company name and logo.
Clickable icons for the following:
*Create content page
*Campaign Analytics page
Greyed out icons for the following:
*Ad Personalization Manager
*Campaign Manager
*Promotional Manager
Each icon will have its image, name, and a brief,  few word definition of what the feature does.  For example, the Ad Personalization Manager may be followed by a brief text that says “Create and manage demographics groups and personalization logic.”

When the user clicks on the Campaign analytics page, they should be taken to a new screen that will show some of the analytics features of our platform.  This view could be designed as a master-detail view and should have the following features:
The user should be able to drill down into different campaigns.  We will show two different campaigns for the demo (matching to the mobile demos):
*AQT logo campaign
*Clothing model campaign
After drilling into a campaign, the user will be able to drill into a demographic group.  At least two demographic groups should be created.
At the top of the view, there should be a filter select for the type of graph being presented.  At least two graphs should be available:
*Total interactions for the ad type.
*Gross purchases resulting from the given ad campaign.
The above features should be implemented such that a user can select a campaign and graph type and see a visualization of the data.  When the user drills down or up, or changes the graph type, the visualization should change accordingly.  The data in the graphs can be pre-built static images.  
There should also be an export data button at the bottom of the view that is greyed out.  This is to show users that we are not trying to provide all the visualizations or analytics they might need.
A way to navigate back to the home screen.

When the user clicks the create new content button, they will be taken to a new page, this page will be a type of form that the user fills out.  This page should have the following items:
The user will be first presented with an image panel that has the option to upload an image.  The image we will allow to be uploaded will be the model image we are using for the dmeo
When the user uploads an image, a new window to the right of the image will be enabled. This will be some sort of list view with the option to add a new item.  There are a few different items that can be added:
*Point of interest.  When this item is added, the user will be able to select a point on the image, and annotate it with a description and a deep link.
*Ad. When this item is added, the user will have the option to select a type of advertisement to ad.   (These ads will be assumed to have been elsewhere in the application, thus the list to choose from will have precomputed names that make sense).
*Promotional item.  This will be a list that is assumed to be managed elsewhere in the application.
Below the content window should be an “Add to Campaign” button that has an associated selection for a campaign (assumed to be created elsewhere).
A way to navigate back to the home screen.
